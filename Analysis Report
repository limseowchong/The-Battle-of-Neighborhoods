# Convenient International Travelling Neglects World's Second Largest Population

## Introduction
With the advancement in technology and relatively strong global economy over the past 10 years, international travelling has become more convenient and affordable. 
As airplanes become more reliable and efficient, managable operating cost have given rise to budget airlines which have made the aviation industry more competitive 
as airlines drive ticket cost down to capture a larger market share. Driven by a growing middle class in emerging economies benefitting from the strong global economy 
and booming aviation industry, more people are able to travel out of their region within hours, to explore other countries and soak in different cultures. According 
to the 2019 Internation Tourism Highlight by the United Nations World Tourism Organisation(UNWTO), international tourist arrivals grew 5% in 2018, reaching the 
1.4 billon mark, two years ahead of UNWTO forecast. (UNWTO, 2019) 

## Business Problem
Islam is the fastest-growing religion in the world and is currently the second largest religious population in the world, with 1.8 billion followers worldwide. This 
also makes Muslim tourists one of the fastest growing segments in the global travel industry. Famous for its culture, performing arts and stunning landscape, France 
is the most visited country in the world, with approximately 89.4 million international tourist arrivals in 2018. However, according to the Mastercard-CrescentRating 
Global Muslim Travel Index (GMTI), a measurement for a country's Muslim-Friendliness, France is ranked 9th with a score of 46.  The availability of Halal food is a 
common concern amongst Muslim when traveling to non-Muslim countries. Halal, in dietary standard, as prescribe in the Muslim scriptures has many restrictions therefore, 
most Muslim prefers to visit Halal-certified or vegitarian/vegan restaurant to eat. This have resulted to Muslims facing difficulties planning travel destinations and 
schedule due to dietary concerns.
